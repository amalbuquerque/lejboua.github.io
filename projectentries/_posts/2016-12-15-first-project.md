title: "Split Planck"

After concluding my master's thesis and starting my new dream job at Onfido, I would like to finally conclude the Split Planck I have on standby for a while now.

The objective is simple: instead of a Planck, I have two halves of a Planck keyboard. I already have the PCB's bought from /u/wootpatoot on reddit, the controllers (Pro Micro's), diodes, switches (Gateron tactile clears and/or Gateron greens). I still have to buy the plates and, the TRRS connectors and the cable which will connect both halves. The plates are being taken care of, I asked a friend to check if he can finds someone who cuts the plates according to a design made by me. The connectors and the cable are easy to find.

Hopefully it won't take too long to have the plates with me so I can conclude this project. The next step is to build a similar split keyboard but with a number row and some additional switches in the middle to use as mouse buttons.

Stay tuned!
