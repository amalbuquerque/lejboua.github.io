The objective is to keep this up to date, with my current interests, projects I'm currently tinkering with, interesting books, tools, and everything in between.

I would also like to post the occasional photo of my son, hopefully before he turns 18 and goes to college :).

I'm a bit busy this Summer, working on my economics thesis you can find more information about the master's programme [here](https://aquila4.iseg.ulisboa.pt/aquila/publico/showDegreeSite.do?method=showDescription&degreeID=282&contentContextPath_PATH=/cursos/emf&locale=en).
